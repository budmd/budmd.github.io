Vivid Skin explores the notions of audio-visual performance through an intimate projection experience; enabling audiences to transcend their everyday realities. 

The installation is formed from a suspended enclosed cylinder, and combines light-projected, audio-reactive visuals with suited music compositions. Multiple projectors are used to create a seamless, 360° vision around the curved surface. 

Audiences are given the opportunity to enter the cylinder individually and immerse themselves within the sensory performance that surrounds them. The installation becomes a window into the world of escapism through music performance.
