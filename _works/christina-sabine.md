“Do you or somebody you know have the difficulty to shop for due to dietary needs? Biteable is an IOS Mobile application to put all of your worries to an end. This application allows you to simply scan a food item’s barcode, and tell you if it contains nuts to if it is vegan. This means that if you are un-aware with a certain dietary need, you won’t have to look though the ingredients in great detail. But instead you will get a simple answer fast and easy. The confusion of eating requirements are now over!”
