Listen Up is an iOS application that represents the diversity of music communities
throughout the UK!

The app provides three main features to users; a constantly updating list that represents the music being shared locally in real time, a map view to give users a visual representation and a search tool to find the most popular artists. The main purpose of the app is to give communities an identity entirely based on the type of music they listen to most, this creates a local chart service that users will feel proud to contribute towards.
