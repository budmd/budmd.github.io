ARNAV is a procedurally-generated visual experience made in Unreal Engine, it takes its users on a journey of self-discovery and relaxation. Experience a course that self-generates as your character slowly moves forward. 

ARNAV’s course is made up of various different environments ranging from Icy cold tundras, enchanting forests and dry deserts each biome has it’s own mood and feel. 

Every single environment tile in ARNAV was made with assets modelled in a Low-Poly art style inspired by real life biomes from around the world, ARNAV can provide some relaxation to any tired individual, all one must do is sit and watch.
