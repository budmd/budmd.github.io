Interpretation of Meeting modernism is a projection mapping installation surrounding the Russell-Coates museum. Using a scaled model of a portion of the museums architecture, the piece will explore in depth the characteristics of several featured artists within the museums ‘Meeting Modernism’ exhibition. 
The performance will explore the themes of classical art and architecture through the modern digital formats and the relationship between the mediums. 
While intended for the entire structure, the exhibit will be a representation of the architecture in maquette form. In doing so creates an interpretation of postmodern framing and advertisement for the museum’s event.
