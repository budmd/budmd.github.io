Snooze Station is an iOS mobile app, used by train and coach commuters that will alert the user at a chosen distance from their station. The alarm will be set using distance in miles, as it is more accurate than time. If the user wakes up, they will be able to see exactly where they are on the map displayed in the app, so there will be no confusion as to where they are. The user can have the option to be woken up by the music on their iPhone or by using the pre set alarms available in the app.
