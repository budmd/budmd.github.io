The “YBU” animation video is designed to be a fun, enjoyable and easy to watch video. The intention is to promote Bournemouth University and reveal just a snippet view of some of the many accolades this educational facility contains. The video is from my own perspective, meaning some of the content within the animation is personal. The main protagonist in this video is called ‘Gordon’, and the animation will be referring to ‘Gordon’ throughout the video. The intention of the animation is simply to appeal to possible future students.
