Inktive is an iOS app that connects tattoo artists to potential customers. It is used as a business/marketing tool by the artist to publish their work. As an artist, you can upload photos to your profile, as well as display where you work, how much you charge as a minimum cost for a tattoo, the opening times of your parlour and the types of tattoos you have mastered. 

As a user, you can save pictures to a mood board and contact the artist directly via email, which will save you both time when you turn up to get inked.
