BrainLink is a mobile application that is designed for Bournemouth University students. The application allows users to access or form instant chat rooms of their own creation. Users can only access and create these chat rooms when they are located inside the Bournemouth University Library. As the library is an academic learning setting, BrainLink connects students who are pro-actively learning, who are invested and actively learning within the University environment. The application shall encourage peer learning and collaboration whilst blending the two dimensions of physical and digital learning spaces.
