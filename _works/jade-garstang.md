Every individual views the world around them differently, and everywhere we look there is often something new to discover. Alternative perspectives is a photography based project exploring several coastal towns of the South East of the UK including; Whitstable, Margate and Dungeness. By using a range of photographic techniques I have demonstrated a personal alternative interpretation of the selection of seaside town environments, with the aim to inspire individuals to explore and discover the places in which they encounter in a whole new way.
