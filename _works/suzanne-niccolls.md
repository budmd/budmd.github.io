I’m Wearing This is a branded system design to be integrated as a product cross-platform. It has been built on the concept of enabling users to explore fashion on Instagram through selected search criteria, for purpose of inspiration and buying. The app designs’ consist of an integrated Instagram API that pulls images to an app from Instagram. These clearly defined images vary across fashion brands and products bought by the customer and represented by the customer, through personally owned photography. The branding has been expanded across social media and the companies’ visual presence.
