Combining glitch art with sculpture, Gormley to Glitch brings the familiarity of the digital into the material world in order to explore its physicality and uncanny nature. Inspired by the visual language of Antony Gormley and his destruction of form, The human figure is glitched and distorted while remaining strangely familiar. Gormley to Glitch blurs the boundaries between digital and physical media, provoking the audience to question the reality of what is before them as these figures are bought to life. The traditional, timeless elegance of sculpture is brutally disrupted by fleeting moments of digital chaos. Gormley to Glitch invites the audience to embrace discomfort and discover the beauty in computation error.
