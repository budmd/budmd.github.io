Studacom is an iOS location-based app that enables university students to find accommodation. 

Students can access and inspect offers from a live database. You may want a room for yourself. With a group of friends, you can find a whole flat or house to share. You can find properties offered within a particular area, using a GPS map or search criteria. Students, as well as owners and estate agents, can post offers. 

Studacomâ€™s services, currently aimed at BU/AUB students, are set to expand. Studacom can make your life easier and enhance the overall quality of your student life.
