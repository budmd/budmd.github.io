In Two Minds is an interactive web-based illustrated story where the player has to make decisions that affect the outcome of the narrative. The story involves a new beginning with a new place, job and friendships. The website is a mixture of interactive elements and digital illustrations. In Two Minds ultimately aims to explore the socialisation of gender through subtly creating gender fluid and diverse characters through a fun, interactive experience.
