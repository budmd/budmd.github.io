EatFly is an IOS application that makes the in-store shopping experience, easier and more enjoyable. It is a unified experience where several parts of existing technology work together synchronously creating an original experience. The app offers an in-store scanner which scans the barcode of items through the camera, allowing the user to purchase items through the phone e.g. Apple Pay. A shopping list that you can update through a search, and gets checked off as you shop. A route maker, creating the quickest route around the store depending on your shopping list. The final part is a social element, where the user can share and explore new recipes which they can add straight to their shopping list.
