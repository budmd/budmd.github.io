For this project, I am working on rebranding a local restaurant in Bournemouth town, Levant Lebanese restaurant. I am working with my client to give him a brand new responsive website, and fresh social media accounts. As well as new menu design, take-away packaging, flyers and business cards. This project aims to update old digital ways into modern techniques.
