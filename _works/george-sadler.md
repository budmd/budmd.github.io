Trophic Cascade is a video series highlighting the benefits of re-wilding Mammals into the British Isles. The content focuses on the damages humanity has inflicted onto the ecosystems of Britain, and how we have the option of re-wilding wolves, lynxes and beavers to fix the majority of our ecological problems. The series is broken down into six episodes and takes the audience through a short journey in the hope that awareness is raised, and that they come away with a basic understanding of re-wilding.
