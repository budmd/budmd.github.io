Snug is a location based service application that allows your friend members to share their location with each other and easily communicate throughout a day. The application allows users to share locations and notify for roadside assistant. Basically the application has 2 main Help Alert and Location sharing. 

Location sharing: app allows users to track each other and figure out approximately when she/he will come back. You can use the app to let your friend know where you are and that you are safe. Especially when you go for a journey. 

Help Alert: works by accelerometer. The accelerometer helps you to make sure that the user that you are tracking is safe. As an example if he/she has accident, the app will let you know.
