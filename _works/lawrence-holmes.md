Songstack is a music discovery app that gives control back to the listener.

Songstack asks users to 'like' or 'dislike' every song that they hear, and in turn future recommendations will become more accurate to the user's taste.

The app encourages listeners to make multiple 'Stacks' for each genre or style of music that they are interested in.

Furthermore, listeners are able to 'tune' these Stacks (by their 'acousticness', 'danceability' etc.) in order to have even more control over what kind of songs they encounter. 

The app is available on the web and iOS, and users' profiles are shared across both of these platforms so you can use both interchangeably.
